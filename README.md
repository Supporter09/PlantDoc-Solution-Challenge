## Guide
- As current project include react-native-vision-camera which is not expo supported because it's native. We need to switch to deployment build and run development server and test with our device
- How to start development server:

```
npx expo start
```
or for SDK 48 and lower, use:
```
npx expo start --dev-client
```
